>Building a predictive model to estimate murder in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAâ€™s) within continental United States


## Problem Statement & Motivation

Murder is a critical problem in urban areas of the United States. In wake of the recent attacks in Los Angeles, the mass shooting in Texas and many more that are yet to come, proactiveness and predictability is crucial to allocate resources for prevention. Using annual murder and manslaughter data collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) for each Metropolitan Statistical Area level along with socioeconomic data from Annual Census and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we seek to build a predictive model that can predict the most recent year (2016) with minimal error using crime statistics of the past.The scope of study is limited to continental United States since our EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) revealed missing information for Puerto Rico. We envision this to evolve into a tool which can be used by state governments and civilians alike to understand future crime.
