Murders and man-slaughter are proving to be a rising concern in all metropolitan areas within United States. In wake of the recent attacks in Los Angeles, the mass shooting in Texas and many more, proactiveness and predictability of these murders is what we need. In this study, we predict the murders and man-slaughter that can occur in the future, leveraging historical data to understand what had typically happened in the past. Annual murder and manslaughter data collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level was programmatically extracted for 11 years. Additional Socio-economic features of an MSA was gathered from the Annual Census Data and BEA (B).

## We iterated through several supervised machine learning argorithms.

Socio-economic variables **do not** have a lot of influence on crime prediction.

## Lets have fun
